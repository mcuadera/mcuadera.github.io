The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of daily life, including my original plans for a field-based thesis project. I quickly pivoted to a project that allowed flexibility in location and also one that would grow my data science skills, focusing my master’s thesis on Long Island, a region highly endemic for tickborne diseases (TBDs) such as Lyme disease, Babesia, and Anaplasma. I identified a critical gap in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding TBDs among Long Island residents, and designed the study to inform priorities for future interventions.

I led the full study design, including survey development, data collection, and advanced statistical analysis. Using a combination of machine learning techniques, including principal component analysis, and regression models, I extracted meaningful insights from the data while managing the project timeline and coordinating resources effectively.

Our findings revealed that Long Island residents generally had low to moderate knowledge of ticks and TBDs, though concern about these diseases was high. Higher concern was associated with a greater likelihood of paying for tick control services and practicing preventative strategies, particularly among individuals with pets, those with previous TBD exposure in the household, and those frequently encountering ticks. These results highlight knowledge gaps, variations in attitudes toward prevention, and factors influencing motivation for tick control, providing actionable guidance for public health messaging and intervention strategies.
