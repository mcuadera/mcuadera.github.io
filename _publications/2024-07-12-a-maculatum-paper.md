In 2022, an established population of Amblyomma maculatum ticks was discovered in Salem County by a Salem County Mosquito Control staff as part of the statewide tick surveillance program established in 2019. Brandon Musnoff notified our staff of the finding, and we quickly surveyed the area for additional ticks. We had found several, and also took some in lab to test for pathogens.

At the time, I was the manager of the New Jersey tick surveillance program, working with several mosquito control districts in collecting tick density information throughout New Jersey. As part of the surveillance program, we also worked with the state public health lab in testing these ticks for pathogen to gather pathogen rate information for several tickborne pathogens, such as Powassan Virus, *Ricketssia sp.*, Anaplasma, Babesia, and *Borrelia sp.*.
