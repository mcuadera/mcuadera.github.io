The paper presents detailed epidemiologic and clinical data on monkeypox in children and adolescents (≤12 years) during the 2022 outbreak. I contributed by providing New Jersey–specific mpox data and supporting the public health response with other state epidemiologists, including assisting local health departments with case assessments, vaccination guidance, and case reviews.

**Background: The 2022 Mpox Outbreak**

The 2022 mpox outbreak was the largest documented globally, affecting over 110 countries outside its endemic regions in West and Central Africa. Transmission occurred primarily through close contact, often within sexual networks, though all populations were susceptible. Cases peaked in mid‑2022 and declined following public health interventions, including targeted vaccination and community awareness campaigns.
