<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov/rdcAVS">rdcAVS</a> package is an R Shiny application designed to assist in automating much of the work that goes 
into setting up the data collection system of vaccination campaigns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I also made it so it can be readily deployed as a web application,
which you can view an example of <a href="https://mcuadera.shinyapps.</p>io/rdcAVS/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
DRC already has a well-established system for collecting vaccination data during campaigns, which meant that the app needed to
balance automation with flexibility to accommodate existing workflows and data structures. The original system relied
heavily on Google Sheets, with data being entered directly into sheets by field teams during campaigns. 

The use of Google Sheets, as well as using its offline capabilities, allowed field teams to continue collecting data even in areas with limited internet connectivity.
However, the data collection sheet was complex and required significant manual setup before each campaign. A sheet 
may have as much as 200 columns, which meant that it was hard to perform data quality checks in real time and also 
monitor the campaigns as it happened. Instead, the quality of the campaign can only be assessed after the campaign was over, which limited the ability to make adjustments during the campaign itself.
</p>

<p>
The rdcAVS app automates much of the setup process for these Google Sheets, reducing the time and effort required to prepare for a campaign. 
It also includes features for monitoring the progress of vaccination campaigns in real time, allowing for better quality assurance on data quality being entered as well as 
faster identification of areas that may need additional support during the campaign.

The key feature of the app is its ability to integrate with Google Sheets and be compatible with existing data 
collection workflows in DRC, reducing the learning curve for field teams and ensuring a smooth transition to using the app. 
It allows users to easily authenticate with their Google account and create or update the necessary sheets for data collection, including managing
of permissions. DRC is a huge country, with data collection during national campaigns often involving multiple hundreds of 
data managers and supervisors, which means that managing permissions for all these users can be a daunting task.
</p>

<p>
There are four main modules in the app:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Management of geographic database:</strong> In order to ensure consistency in data collection, 
        the app relies on a standardized geographic database so that data collection sheets as well as permissions are set up correctly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Campaign creation:</strong> Automates the creation and configuration of the folder hierarchy in Google Sheets for data collection, as 
        well as the creation of the data collection sheet. The app also automatically creates summary sheets by collating data sheets from lower geographic levels, from the district to the national level.</li>
    <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> Simplifies the process of managing user permissions for Google Sheets, allowing administrators to easily add users and set appropriate access levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Surveillance and Data Quality Monitoring:</strong> Provides real-time monitoring of data quality during vaccination campaigns, with visualizations and alerts to help identify potential issues.
    In addition, provides visuals for tracking the progress of vaccination campaigns, presenting metrics important for monitoring campaign progress and identifying sites that require additional assistance.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
With the rdcAVS app, the process of setting up and monitoring vaccination campaigns in DRC has become significantly more efficient and effective. 
By automating key tasks and providing real-time insights into campaign progress, the app has helped to improve data quality and ensure that vaccination efforts are reaching those who need them most.
I am the primary developer of the application and managed its conception, design, and implementation, working closely with stakeholders in DRC to ensure that the app met their needs and requirements.
