<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>
rdcAVS is an R Shiny app that automates the setup of Google Sheets-based data collection and provides real-time monitoring for vaccination campaigns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<h3>Problem & Solution</h3>
<p></p>
Campaign data collection relied on complex Google Sheets (often hundreds of columns) and manual setup, making real-time quality checks difficult. rdcAVS streamlines sheet creation, permissions, and aggregation, enabling faster deployment and live data quality monitoring so teams can act during a campaign rather than after.
</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets integration:</strong> Automated creation and configuration of campaign folders and sheets; handles permissions and summaries across geographic levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Geographic database:</strong> Standardized geo data to ensure consistent sheet structure and accurate aggregation.</li>
    <li><strong>Permission management:</strong> Bulk user and role management to simplify access for hundreds of data managers and supervisors.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time surveillance & data quality:</strong> Dashboards, alerts, and visuals to track progress and surface data issues during campaigns.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployable:</strong> Designed for easy web deployment and compatibility with existing field workflows (including offline-friendly Google Sheets use).</li>
</ul>

<p>
I was the primary developer responsible for design and implementation, working with stakeholders in DRC to ensure the app matched operational needs.
