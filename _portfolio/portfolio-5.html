<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>
To help my sister with her wedding, I built and deployed a responsive wedding website to GitHub Pages. The site is available at <a href="https://khaeby.github.io">khaeby.github.io</a>, and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/Khaeby/Khaeby.github.io">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
I started from a GitHub template (<a href="https://github.com/shyamjos/wedding-website">shyamjos/wedding-website</a>), forked it, and customized the HTML and CSS based on my sister's feedback. I ensured the site looks good on both desktop and mobile, added sections for event details, RSVP functionality, and a photo gallery, and updated the favicon and social preview thumbnails.
